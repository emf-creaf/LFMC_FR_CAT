# Predicting live fuel moisture content dynamics with process-based models in Mediterranean forests

##### Albert Sañé Codony MSc project

### ABSTRACT 

Although wildfires are a natural component of Mediterranean ecosystems, their frequency and intensity are increasing because of climate change, extending fire seasons, and elevating wildfire risk. A critical factor influencing fire behaviour is live fuel moisture content (LFMC), the moisture content of live foliage and small twigs. This study attempts to improve the modelling of LFMC dynamics in Mediterranean forests evaluating the predictive performance of the process-based model MEDFATE. We used data from 37 plots across the Mediterranean areas of Catalonia and SE of France, to simulate LFMC. We assessed how different data sources employed as MEDFATEs inputs influenced the model predictive LFMC accuracy. In addition, we compared the LFMC predictions generated by a Fully-Mechanistic approach with a Semi-Mechanistic method, which combines a process-based predawn leaf water potential (Ψpd) with an empirical LFMC relationship. Overall, a wide range of LFMC predictive performance was observed. The median MAE across all simulations was 20.89, the median R² was 0.31, and the median bias was 15.45. The results indicate that the Semi-Mechanistic approach demonstrated significantly better performance than the Fully-Mechanistic approach, it achieved a lower median MAE of 19.30 compared to 22.90 for the Fully-Mechanistic approach and a higher median R² of 0.33 versus 0.29. The Simulations using MODIS-derived LAI, modified soil data with rock content adjustments, and meteorological data from local weather stations, produced the most accurate LFMC predictions. These findings demonstrate the importance of accurate physiological parameterisation and high-quality input data in LFMC predictions obtained by means of process-based modelling.
